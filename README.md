Predicting house prices for real estate investments using machine learning

1. Created script for fetching data, which should be run anytime you expect the data to have updated.














## Tips/Lessons Learned:

1. The histograms were tail-heavy (most of the data was skewed right relative to median). 
This could be a problem for the learning algorithm. Uniform, Bell-Shaped data is preferred.

2. Be aware for capped values of data if you expect to receive data points outside of this 
range in the real world. You will not be able to predict well. 

3. You want to keep the same test set no matter how many times you run the algoirthm because if not, the algorithm will eventually see the entire dataset.
